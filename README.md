# Data Engineering Project
Scrapping et stockage sur base MongoDB d'un site de vente immobili√®re

The Data Engineering project is a school project done during the 4th year of engineering school at ESIEE Paris.</br>
The aim of this project is to scrap and store data from a website. Then, the goal is to permit the data access trough a local web portal. In this project, we had to scrap, store and make accecible data from a real estate website, called [ORPI](https://www.orpi.com/?utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&msclkid=26b36418dde91e469c873efcb7e2f34b&gclid=CMnUhJn93NoCFUbNGQodJqcEVA&gclsrc=ds "ORPI website").

## Getting Started

The project is runnable via a docker container.</br>
That's all.

The instructions below are destined to a Linux based usage. This doesn't mean the project won't work on another environment, but the instructions to do so aren't displayed here.

### Prerequisites

* This library is __built with Python 3__.

> If you do not have Python 3 on your computer, to install it with linux is :
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.6
```
(or follow this [link](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/linux/ "Python 3 installation"))

* Make sure you have __docker__ on your computer.

> To install Docker with pip (Python 3) :
```
$ pip3 install docker
```

### Installing

* You must clone the git dir or download it on your computer.
```
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/charleswit/GuessMyAddress.git
```

* Using Docker, you have to build the Docker image with :
```
$ docker build -t [name of the image] .
$ docker run -it [name of the image]
```
> *If you need a Docker tutorial and/or explore its possibilities, go to [this link](https://docker-curriculum.com/ "Docker tutorial")*

* Once you are in the docker image with the '**docker run**' command, the required libraries should have been installed and our application is ready to be used !


## How it works

The basic use of our project lies in building the web application, coded with the Python framework __Flask__.
The scrapped and stored data are information about a property advertisement in the ORPI web site.

Basically, the web app is used only for displaying the information. But it contains an __advance search function__, to order the result and/or have more relevent information.

To access the web portal, you will have to open a browser, and go to this [link](http://127.0.0.1:5000 "Web portal") :
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
Then, you are in the app, enjoy !

## Built With

* [Flask](flask.pocoo.org/) - Permited to build the web application
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/fr/) - Used for data managment
* [Scrappy](https://scrapy.org/) - Brilliant scrapping framework
